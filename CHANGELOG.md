## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-24

The first version: a fast, live, read-only viewer for the markdown documentation of a project.

### Added

- Open a folder with the system dialog or from the recent folders (missing folders are flagged
  and can be removed).
- Markdown-only Explorer: `.md`/`.markdown` files and the folders that contain them;
  `.gitignore`, `.ignore` and `.git/info/exclude` respected; `.git` and `node_modules` always
  skipped; toggles for dotfiles and ignored files; extra ignore patterns in Settings; background
  indexing with progress; lazy, virtualized tree that stays smooth with 10,000+ files; full
  keyboard navigation.
- Preview: GitHub Flavored Markdown, GitHub alerts, Shiki code highlighting with a copy button,
  KaTeX math, YAML front matter card, images and videos with an "Open externally" fallback,
  anchor, web and relative markdown links, HTML sanitization.
- Mermaid diagrams with zoom, pan, fit, reset, full screen and copy source.
- VS Code-style tabs (preview and pinned tabs, context menu, keyboard shortcuts).
- Live reload of the tree and open documents when files change on disk, keeping the scroll
  position; deleted and renamed files handled; polling fallback when native watching is
  unavailable.
- Change notifications with batching (one grouped notification for bursts), details and muting.
- Light, Dark, High Contrast and Follow System themes.
- VS Code-style title bar with menus (File, Edit, View, Help), mnemonics and a native-frame
  fallback.
- Settings: theme, font size, reading width, window frame, notifications, ignore patterns,
  defaults, app-data folder, reset.
- Per-folder session restore (tabs, scroll positions, expanded folders, layout) and window
  position and size.
- SVG logo, app icons and an animated splash screen.
- Keyboard shortcuts reference (F1), About dialog, accessibility pass (focus, roles, contrast,
  reduced motion).
- Continuous integration on Windows and Linux (lint, unit tests, end-to-end smoke tests, build
  check) and installer builds (NSIS, MSI, AppImage, .deb).
